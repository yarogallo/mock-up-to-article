1- What new skills have you learned?

 What is HTML, How use it in order to create Web Pages, some of it's elements
 and features.

2- What has been easy?

I guess that there is nothing easy. Even when you think it is easy.

3- What has been difficult?

For me the most difficult part is when Im on my own and I have to figure out how apply
the content that I have been learning in the classroom.

4- How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I have a notebook, so I use my notes all the time. When I get stuck, I review the lesson again,
I do research online(Mozilla Network Developer, Udacity forum, Stack  Overflow), for extra HTML resources I like reading
"HTML5 doctor site" because its articles about tags and I also find interesting the official "W3C's HTML specs".
